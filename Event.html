            <h1 class="title">UN Celebration Day </h1>
            <p class="text">On Saturday evening, 10 of our students participate in a SCIA event for celebrating the UN day. We thought it's an non-educational event, but it turns out to be an educational ones. our students were divided into small group of 3 to compete against the other team about the UN goal that they got. A team about goal 13 (climate action) won the first place! Besides competing, we've learn so much about SDGs as well as talking with the representor from UNDP.

                    we ate some good food from 6 different countries and watch the kids perform as well! it was sooooo cute, especially with those outfits that represent their county. </p>
