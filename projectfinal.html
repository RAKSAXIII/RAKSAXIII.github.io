        <h2 class="trip">Trip to S-21</h3>
        <p class="reflection">I can feel goosebump since stop 2 until the next building. In building B, I didn’t expect the picture of the victim to be that clear. looking at those faces, I wish they could survive to show all of their smiles and beautiful pride. I drop a few tears when I saw those baby faces on the board. Especially when I see the lady that was sitting and I can see her baby on the side even though it’s not on focus. He looked so cute! I know he died, I felt sorry for him.
            To make my experience clearer, I’ve talked to my dad the whole hour last night about his experienced, so I have more ideas of what exactly happened.  
            Choeung ek doesn’t have the listed name of the victims, so it felt less intense. Imagine going to s-21 and see one of your relatives name on there…. 
            There are pictures, painting and a lot of blood remaining while the killing field have only bone and fabric + skulls

        <h2 class="KF">Killing Field Prediction</h2>
        <p class="prediction">I think I'll see a lot of skulls and bones they are kept inside a specific place. There might be some of the tools that they use to kill all of the victims. Just imagining the picture, it makes me goosebumps already. I might feel sorrowful mad at the same time. Like, seeing all of my countrymate die because of ridiculous reason from the leaders. I wish I could do something to help them! My pettiness and madness would not make any lives to re-alive. It would make any better. I’m sensitive to smells and creepy image, so I might feel hesitate to look at something. I’ll try my best to not though.I expect Choeung Ek to look like a jail. Fill with forest or trees. Probably not a lot of people are there to take care of. I expect the place to have many different shed for putting different leftover tools from Khmer rouge. </p>

    <h2 class="know">What I want to Know</h2>
    <p class="interest">By seeing the plan document yesterday, I believe we will understand about Khmer rouge more than the past 7 weeks. Since we watch a lot about the real documentary, I hope to know the exact reason why khmer rouge happen and who ended it. If we can interview a lot of people, I’ll ask them about the rumors and see if it’s real or not. Those can be like, stealing food, things we didn’t know as well as how they survive… Khmer rouge give mental problem to those who involve, I wonder if they ever try to give revenge or is there anyone who feel bad until they go unconscious? Well, I think we’ll know about all of these after this exploration. However, I also hope we learn something that is beyond the Khmer rouge. It doesn’t have to be the full information, just the highlights and how it affected by or lead to Khmer rouge.  </p>
